The world remains woefully of track in meeting the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero carbon dioxide CO2 emissions globally by 2050.  </h3>

                <h3 class="climate">In ETS, companies are allocated carbon credits. This basically means that specific companies are allowed to produce a capped amount of CO2e emissions. If the capped amount is has been exceeded, the company will be charged with a high amount. This scheme allows companies to basically trade and sell their credits to other companies. So, companies that are under their emissions on a fiscal year can sell their credits to others who are as efficient as them.</h3>
